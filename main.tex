I am currently investigating the relationship between epigenetic factors and genetic splicing as part of a  BBSRC Doctoral Training Programme PhD project at the University of Cambridge. As part of my PhD programme, the BBSRC will fully fund a 3 month internship which I would like to undertake at Oxford Nanopore. I am interested in the technology being developed at Oxford Nanopore and would like to learn how to work with the data produced by MinION. I am keen to apply the skills I have developed academically in an industrial setting. }
